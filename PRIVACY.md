# Privacy Policy for Marktkraam Browser Extension

**Published Date:** February 25, 2025

## 1. Introduction

This Privacy Policy explains our practices regarding any data in relation to your use of the Marktkraam extension ("we", "our", or "the extension"). We are committed to protecting your privacy.

## 2. Data Collection

Marktkraam is designed with your privacy in mind. **We do not collect any personal or sensitive user data.**

Specifically, Marktkraam does not collect, transmit, use, or share any of the following:

- Personally identifiable information (PII) such as your name, address, phone number, email address, username, or any identification numbers.
- Financial and payment information.
- Health information.
- Authentication information (logins, passwords, cookies).
- Website content and resources you access.
- Form data you enter on websites.
- Your web browsing activity (domains, URLs, HTTP requests, cookies).
- Personal communications.
- User-generated content.

Marktkraam operates solely on your local browser and performs its ad-blocking function by injecting CSS and Javascript code directly into the webpages you visit on marktplaats.nl. It does not communicate with any external servers or collect any data about your browsing activity.

## 3. Use of Data

As Marktkraam does not collect any user data, we do not use any user data. The extension functions based on locally processed rules to block advertisements on marktplaats.nl.

## 4. Sharing of Data

Because we do not collect any user data, we do not share any user data with third parties.

## 5. Data Security

Since Marktkraam does not handle any personal or sensitive user data, data security measures for user data are not applicable. The extension itself is built to operate locally in your browser and does not transmit any data externally.

## 6. Changes to this Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page, and we encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically. The "Published Date" at the top of this Privacy Policy indicates when it was last revised.

## 7. Contact Us

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or the Marktkraam extension, please contact us at the email address provided in the extension's Chrome Web Store listing.
